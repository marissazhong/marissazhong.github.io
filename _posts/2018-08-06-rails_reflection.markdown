While I was very happy to pass my Rails assessment, in truth, there were so many features that I thought would be very interesting to implement. I listed some on my last blog, but to recap, I would have loved to try to implement: 

* a more robust database for recipes, such as additional columns for ratings and comments.
* further data validation and manipulation for already inputted information, such as quantities. I would love to have an app that has the ability to scale to different serving sizes and also display nutritional information. 
* more scope methods that allows the user to filter by attributes such as quickest prep time and most recently created. 

As I'm moving forward into JS, I realize that one feature in particular I have already successfully implemented - the ability to dynamically add rows to the forms for new recipes. This is contained within a <script> tag in the form view. I look forward to implementing more dynamic features that allow the user to interact with the page without reloading. 

In moving towards the end of the curriculum, I can reflect on how much I appreciate the different parts of the curriculum coming together and now how I have a holistic understanding of the different aspects of an app (model-view-controller, I'm looking at you!). The most interesting concepts/topics I have taken away from this curriculum so far are:

* MVC and separation of concerns - how we organize our code into readable components both for our own clarity and debugging but also for a greater team's understanding and ease of use. 
* Forms, buttons, and event listeners - how the user not just see information available through the app, but interact with and input their own information. Validations have been a huge part of this, and while my Rails project validations were not terribly robust, I look forward to tightening them up in the future to a more professional level.
* Database creation, organization, and management - While I have been a user of many similar products and apps, the central role of databases was not immediately clear until I started working on these projects. Clearly, in today's day and age, data is critical to any company's product, both from a business perspective (how to use the data to create value) and from a management perspective (managing scale of users, recipes, etc.). 

I look forward to carrying all this new knowledge forward onto the remaining two portfolio projects and in my future career!
