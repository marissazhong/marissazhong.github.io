For my final assessment, I decided to create a recipes manager. While I seeded some dessert recipes into my database, the manager is not limited to desserts. Users can input any type of recipe they so choose!

While this project involved many components that needed to be built and connected, I really appreciated being at the end of the curriculum and having this opportunity to apply all the skills I've learned to build a simple, but professional website front to back. 

The new knowledge that I applied on this project were the React/Redux front end components, where I built routes for all recipes, user recipes, and login. I built multiple container and presentation components for all of these, including but not limited to: RecipeShow, RecipeNew, NavBar, and AllRecipesPage. By hooking the app up with Bootstrap, I was able to quite easily enhance the layout of the app and also using Bootstrap, understand the different types of elements and how they are organized/managed with a framework like Bootstrap. 

On the back end, I hooked up my Rails back end, which include models for Users, Recipes, and Ingredients. Users and recipes have a has_many/belongs_to relationship, whereas recipes and ingredients have a many-to-many relationship. 

Prior to starting this bootcamp, I have to admit that I knew nothing about how the internet was structured and how all of the apps/products that we rely on in our daily lives were built. Now, I can confidently say that I understand far more about what goes on behinds the scenes when I click away on Apps on my laptop or phone. I now know I have the experience to develop my own websites with the frameworks I have learned here, as well as the conceptual knowledge to learn other frameworks and the criteria on which they were built.
