As I wrap up my rails app portfolio project, I can definitively say that this was by far the most involved and rewarding project so far. Not only was I working on a topic that I cared about (desserts, because who doesn't love sweets!), but the increasing levels of complexity were sometimes frustrating but mostly satisfying to ultimately complete. I love to systematically break down elements of an app that I see in commercial products all the time, and implement them for myself. 

Some of the elements of my app that I am most of are:
* dual login methods of new accounts and logins through Facebook.
* a pantry feature that allows users to add which ingredients they have currently in their pantry, and see the recipes that they can make with those ingredients.

Some of the features I would love to implement in the future are:
* validations for quantities and ability to scale recipes to serving sizes.
* increased validations for duplicate ingredients and types of ingredients (ie "sugar, white" vs. "white sugar" and "brown" vs. "white" sugar).
* more user interaction, such as with comments or ratings.
