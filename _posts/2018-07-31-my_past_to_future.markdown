In hindsight, I realize I have dabbled in programming and computer science on and off throughout my life. While I did not choose computer science as a career post-college, I can see how technology is an integral part of many fields and will only increasingly become so. 

For the past 5 years, I've been working as a structural engineer in NYC, where I have worked on designs for large-scale infrastructure projects, from bridges to train stations. As a professional engineer, I have only increasingly experienced the frustrations in the limits of current industry software. There are countless aspects of the industry that can be improved by better software. Here's a few of my visions for the future:
* Seamless compatibility between survey, architectural, and analysis models
* Full automation of building code analysis and structural design
* Adaption of 3D models and elimination of 2D drawings (blueprints will be vintage items hung on the wall)
* Comprehensive project controls software, such as for cost estimating and scheduling

I do not know where my current path will lead, but I hope in the future I can combine my past experience and my future experience to improve the efficiency of professional industries such as engineering design and construction.
